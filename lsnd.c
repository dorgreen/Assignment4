//Write a user program called “lsnd” that will pull the following information for each inode
//in use:
//<#device> <#inode> <is valid> <type> <(major,minor)> <hard links> <blocks used>

// TODO: IMPLEMENT!
// should read from the folder /proc/inodeinfo
// each file in that folder has the data we need for each used inode :)
